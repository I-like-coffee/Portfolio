								<b><em>Inspiration</em></b><br>
								Back to the Golden Age of <u>Mobile Phone Games</u> a few years back, a prominent, nostalgic game constantly comes to mind,
								<b>Flappy Bird</b>. However, on 02.2014, Flappy Bird was taken down by its creator for the hateful sentiments he recieved. 
								However, I still do believe that despite the previous negative publicity of the game, it still deserves to exist as a memorabilia, 
								of the past, the age of when Flappy Bird dominated the then infant Mobile Game Industry. Thus, I re-made <b>Flappy Bird</b> as Flutter Bird, 
								the past tense to symbolise it's previous departure from the App Store.

								<b><em>Challenges Faced</em></b><br>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<b>Challenge:</b>
										Latency
										<br>
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										<u><em>Identifying Factors:</em></u><br>
										Loops, Client Network Connectivity, Operations
										<br>
										<u><em>Loops:</em></u><br>
										Loops cause a huge stress on the Server and Client alike. By reducing the amount of Loops being
										created or ran at any one point of time can reduce stress and in turn, improve latency.
										<br>
										<u><em>Operations:</em></u><br>
										Creation and Destruction of Objects cause an instantaneous strain on the Server and Client. By reducing or avoiding
										ammased creation and destruction events, strain is reduced and in turn, improves latency. Thus, the background, where 
										clouds were previously created, placed at Screen-Right and Tweened to Screen-Left, then destroyed, is a huge contributing factor.
										Therefore, I switched it to a "Redo" Type method. Where at the start of the Client, a set amount of clouds are created, set to
										Screen-Right and are orderly Tweened to Screen-Left with randomised delay. After which are re-set to Screen-Right to repeat the
										process infinitely until the Client disconnects.
