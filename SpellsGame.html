								<b><em>Inspiration</em></b><br>
								Over my few years playing games on <a href="https://roblox.com/" target="_blank">ROBLOX</a>, I have come across my fair share of spell games.
								Coupled with my extremist love for the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise, I then decided to create my own game interpretation in 2021.

								<b><em>Challenges Faced</em></b><br>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<b>Challenge:</b>
										Animating spells travelling
										<br>
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										<u><em>Getting the spell direction:</em></u><br>
										Firstly, on detecting the client pressing the corresponding spell keybind, the client's mouse position on the 2d screen is translated into a
										3d CFrame in the game and sent to the server.
										<br>
										<u><em>Moving the spell:</em></u><br>
										I settled on using Raycasting to check for future collisions between the spell itself and a physical quantity in the game
										for each iteration of animating the spell travelling on it's course. If there was to be a collision, after animating the moving the spell object
										to it's last vector3 position, it triggers an event to manage the visual and code of a collision of that specific spell.
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>
										<b>Challenge:</b>
										Animating Black Thunder Spell
										<br>
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										<u><em>Calculating Position Vector3:</em></u><br>
										Firstly, I take the magnitude of the difference between the client's player model poition and the client's mouse position in the 3d space,
										lets call this value X<sub>0</sub>.
										If X<sub>0</sub> is lesser than or equal to the range, in this case 60, the Direction Vector3, X<sub>final</sub>,
										will be the the vector3 drawn from the client's player model to the client's mouse position in 3d space.
										However, if X<sub>0</sub> is greater than the range, X<sub>final</sub> will be calculated by first calculating the CFrame at the client's player model
										pointing at the client's mouse position in 3d space, let's call this X<sub>1</sub>. Next we multiple X<sub>1</sub>'s LookVector' with the range to get
										the Vector3 position, X<sub>2</sub>, of the intersection between X<sub>1</sub>'s LookVector and a sphere with radius range, in this case 60.
										<br>
										<u><em>Calculating Spell Start Position:</em></u><br>
										Now, We have X<sub>final</sub> which either rests on or within a sphere with radius range, in this case 60, around the client's player model.
										To calculate the spell's starting position, we first have to multiple X<sub>final</sub> with Vector3(1,0,1) to have a Vector3 with
										only the X and Z axises and a Y axis of 0, which we will call X<sub>3</sub>. Next, we add X<sub>3</sub> with the client's player model's
										Y value that we find by multiplying the client's player model's position by the Vector(0,1,0), call this X<sub>4</sub>.
										To find the final starting position, we take X<sub>4</sub> added with the Vector3(0,Ygain,0) where Ygain is the height in which the spell
										starts at relative to the client's player model.
										<br>
										<u><em>Moving the spell:</em></u><br>
										Similar to Challenge 1's Moving solution, we use raycasting. However, instead of moving the spell based on it's CFrame LookVector,
										we move this spell based on it's CFrame UpVector multiplied by -1 to get a "DownVector".
